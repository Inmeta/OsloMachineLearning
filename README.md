# Oslo Machine Learning

Here you can find the presentations and materials from Oslo Machine Learning meetup.

Oslo Machine Learning is a group for anyone who wishes to learn more about machine learning. We wish to address the full value chain of data science, and discuss technical challenges as well as concepts.
Although the talks in general have a technical focus -- for instance addressing analysis, algorithms, training and deployment to production -- a conceptual context is usually also given.

Oslo Machine Learning is initiated and supported by Inmeta and open to everyone. We offer a space to learn and to connect to the community of people interested in machine learning.
